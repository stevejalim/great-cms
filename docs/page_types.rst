Design Philosophy
-----------------

Great use a parent child relationship.
The number of page types has been kept to the lowest possible. More control is given on the page layout with the selection of a custom template.

.. note::

        Home Page -> Listing Page -> Detail Page


===================== =================
Parent Page Type      Child Page Types
