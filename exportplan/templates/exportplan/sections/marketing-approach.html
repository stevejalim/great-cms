<!-- <p>For each market and product or service, consider the methods and channels you’ll use to get your goods to the market (for example direct selling or franchising, or through an online marketplace or social media). Record how you’ll get people to know about your offer, and the budget and resource you’ll need to allocate to this.</p>
<p>Again, you might want to record this in a grid to present the facts clearly.</p>

    <h3 class="h-m">Demographic Content personalised for {{ country.name }}</h3>

    <p>{{ country.name }} for {{ country.year_population }} has a total estimated population of {{ country.population|intcomma }}, in {{ country.year_population }} this was split with {{ country.urban_percentage }}% being in Urban areas and {{ country.rural_percentage }}% in Rural areas.</p>

    <p>Urban locations are self defined by individual countries. They tend to be defined as areas with a higher density of people and buildings which generally suggests a higher level of amenities and activity.</p>

    <p>Based on your target demographic {{ age_range.age_range }} the estimated population is split into {{ age_range.population_female|intcomma }} Females and {{ age_range.population_male|intcomma }} Males.</p>

    <p>From data in {{ country.year_income }} individuals in {{ country.name }} earn on average a national income of {{ country.average_income|intcomma }} in USD, for comparison an individual in the UK earns on average {{ united_kingdom.average_income|intcomma }} in USD.</p>

    <p>Overall {{ country.name }} has a Consumer Price Index of {{ country.consumer_price_index }}, the higher this number the more it costs for individuals to purchase products in their own currency.</p>

    <p>You may need to consider how your product is marketed based on the income, age and culture of your consumers.</p>
